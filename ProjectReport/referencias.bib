    abstract={Inspired by the sophisticated functionality of human brains where hundreds of billions    of interconnected neurons process information in parallel, researchers have successfully tried demonstrating certain levels of intelligence on silicon. Examples include language translation and pattern recognition software. While simulation of human consciousness and emotion is still in the realm of science fiction, we, in this chapter, consider artificial neural networks as universal function approximators. Especially, we introduce neural networks which are suited for time series forecasts.},

	abstract = {Objection detection is of vital importance to many fields, such as autonomous driving, outdoor robotics, and computer vision. Existing approaches on object detection can hardly run on the resource-constrained edge devices. In order to mitigate this dilemma, we propose to apply TensorFlow Lite to convert Float32 neural network model to unit8 neural network with subtle or even no accuracy loss. Two advantages are here for conversion. First, it reduces the model size to a quarter so that it fits for devices with limited storage. Second, it achieves much faster inference time. I conduct an experiment on MSCOCO dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves mAP 72.1 and FPS 23 on edge device.}

   abstract = {With the advancement in deep learning in the past few years, we are able to create complex machine learning models for detecting objects in images, regardless of the characteristics of the objects to be detected. This development has enabled engineers to replace existing heuristics-based systems in favour of machine learning models with superior performance. In this report, we evaluate the viability of using deep learning models for object detection in real-time video feeds on mobile devices in terms of object detection performance and inference delay as either an end-to-end system or feature extractor for existing algorithms. Our results show a significant increase in object detection performance in comparison to existing algorithms with the use of transfer learning on neural networks adapted for mobile use. },
